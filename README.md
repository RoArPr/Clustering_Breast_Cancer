Unsupervised analysis to cluster breast cancer

## Description
This work is part of my capstone project 'Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree' at Udacity (Dec, 2017).
I performed an unsupervised analysis to cluster breast cancer using the dataset, pam50 protein levels, described in the paper:
'Proteogenomics connects somatic mutations to signalling in breast cancerâ€™. Philipp Mertins and co.Nature. 2016. 
The dataset is also posted in Kaggle.

The project is written in Python and can be run using notebook:                                                
          **'clustering_kmeans_pca.ipynb'**. 


#### Following files contain the data:
'data_analysis.csv': normalized protein levels of the pam50 genes                                                            
'protein_description.csv': description of the complete proteins dataset 

#### Procedures:
'procedures_cluster.py': procedure to apply silhouette analysis, which is an adaptation of the one shown by scikit-learn.org 
'pca.py': procedure to apply Principal components analysis
